# piggie

A cljs-node app.


On osX
rlwrap -r -m  '\"' -b "(){}[],^%3@\";:'" lein trampoline noderepl

lein trampoline cljsbuild auto


if you want to work directly with the js generated you have to quit :target :nodejs and :optimizations :simple also... besides to adapt your source-paths and output-to properties in project.clj
